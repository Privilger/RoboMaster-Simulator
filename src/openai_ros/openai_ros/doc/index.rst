Welcome to openai_ros's documentation!
======================================

This ROS package http://wiki.ros.org/openai_ros
Its a structure to make it easy to use OpenAI with ROS and Gazebo.
You will find environments for most of the common robots used in
ROS so that you only have to code the AI part, and don't worry on the
connection to the Physical/Simulated robot.
